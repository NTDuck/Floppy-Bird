### Welcome to my first project,
# **Floppy Bird** !


## **Quick start guide**
----
**Floppy Bird** is a 2D Sprite game project created with [pygame](https://www.pygame.org/). The link to this can be found [here](https://github.com/NTDuck/Floppy-Bird).

After downloading and extracting the `.zip` file, navigate to `trojan.exe` to start the game. Wait a couple of seconds, and as soon as you see a flying racoon, the game is up and running. 

Press `[SPACE]` to jump. Try to go through as many pipes as possible. It should be similar to the original Flappy Bird.

Though the quality of this game pales into insignificance besides the original game, I really do hope that this will partially bring back the 2014's good old days.

Now, enjoy!
